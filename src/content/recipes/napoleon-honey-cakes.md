## The Emperor's Sweet Tooth

Napoleon Bonaparte may have conquered much of Europe, but he had a particular weakness for honey cakes—a treat that reminded him of his Corsican roots and provided quick energy during his military campaigns. These small, spiced cakes were often packed in his travel rations and served at imperial banquets.

## Historical Context

During his campaigns across Europe, Napoleon's army traveled with field kitchens that could produce these honey cakes quickly. The honey provided essential calories for marching soldiers, while the spices were both preservative and morale-boosting. Josephine reportedly served these at Malmaison, and they became a favorite at imperial court gatherings.

The recipe we're using today is adapted from a 1804 French military cookbook, with ingredients that would have been available to Napoleon's personal chef during the height of the Empire.

## Instructions

### Preparing the Base

1. **Preheat your oven** to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. **Warm the honey** in a small saucepan over low heat until it becomes fluid and fragrant. Don't let it boil. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.

3. **Combine dry ingredients** in a large bowl: flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, and salt. Whisk together thoroughly.

### Making the Batter

4. **In another bowl**, cream the softened butter until light. Add the warm honey and mix well.

5. **Beat in the eggs** one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next.

6. **Alternate adding** the dry ingredients and warm milk to the honey mixture, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Mix until just combined—don't overmix.

### Baking

7. **Drop spoonfuls** of batter onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. They should be roughly the size of a walnut.

8. **Bake for 12-15 minutes** until the edges are lightly golden and the tops spring back when gently touched.

9. **Cool on the baking sheet** for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.

10. **Dust with powdered sugar** just before serving.

## Chef's Notes

The original recipe would have used raw honey from French beehives and spices imported through Napoleon's extensive trade networks. The cakes were often made in large batches and stored in sealed containers for the army's long marches.

These honey cakes improve with age—wrap them well and they'll keep for up to a week, developing a deeper, more complex flavor that Napoleon himself would have recognized.

## Historical Serving Suggestions

Serve these as Napoleon would have—with strong coffee or brandy after a meal, or pack them for a journey as the Emperor did during his famous march to Moscow. They pair beautifully with aged French cheeses or can be enjoyed simply on their own as a sweet reminder of imperial France.
