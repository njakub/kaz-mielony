## Feast Overview

This single recipe walks through the entire Hale-inspired Thanksgiving meal: sausage stuffing, roast turkey with gravy, honey glazed carrots, buttered turnips, creamy mashed potatoes, and a custard-set pumpkin pie. Follow the timeline to keep everything hot when the turkey is ready to carve.

## Instructions

### 1. Dry the Bread

1. Heat the oven to 120C (250F). Spread the bread cubes on trays and bake for 20 to 30 minutes, tossing once, until dry but pale. Cool and reserve.

### 2. Make the Stuffing

1. In a large bowl combine sausage meat, egg, onion, thyme, sage, salt, and pepper.
2. Fold in the dried bread and drizzle in 60 ml milk. Mix with your hands until the stuffing holds together when squeezed. Add extra milk or crumbs to balance.
3. Cover and refrigerate while you prep the turkey.

### 3. Prepare the Turkey

1. Raise the oven to 180C (355F).
2. Pat the turkey dry inside and out. Season the cavity with a pinch of salt and pepper.
3. Loosely fill the neck and main cavity with stuffing, stopping when the mix meets the opening so hot air can circulate.
4. Spread softened butter over the skin. Season all over with the remaining salt and pepper.
5. Arrange chopped onions, carrots, and celery in a large roasting pan. Set the turkey on top, tuck the wings under, and tie the legs together with kitchen twine.

### 4. Roast the Turkey

1. Roast for 3 to 4 hours, basting every 30 minutes with pan juices and extra melted butter if needed.
2. The turkey is done when the stuffing reaches 74C (165F) and the thickest part of the thigh reads 74C (165F).
3. Transfer the turkey to a platter, tent with foil, and rest for 20 to 30 minutes.

### 5. Pan Gravy

1. Set the roasting pan over medium heat. Add the reserved turkey neck and 3 tbsp flour. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes to form a roux.
2. Gradually whisk in the stock, scraping up browned bits.
3. Simmer for 8 to 10 minutes until glossy and thick enough to coat a spoon. Strain, then season to taste.

### 6. Roast the Vegetables

1. Increase the oven to 220C (430F).
2. Toss carrots with olive oil, honey, salt, and pepper. Spread on a tray.
3. In a second bowl coat turnips with olive oil, sage, salt, and pepper. Spread on another tray.
4. Roast turnips for 30 to 35 minutes, turning once, until tender. Toss with 2 tsp butter to finish.
5. Roast carrots for 15 to 25 minutes until lightly browned. Sprinkle with parsley.

### 7. Mashed Potatoes

1. Boil potatoes in salted water for 15 to 20 minutes until a knife slides in easily.
2. Drain well, return to the pot, and let the steam escape for 1 minute.
3. Mash with butter and milk until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Cover to keep warm.

### 8. Pumpkin Pie

1. Reduce the oven to 200C (390F).
2. For the crust, mix flour and salt. Rub in the cold butter until coarse crumbs form. Sprinkle in ice water, 1 tbsp at a time, mixing just until the dough holds together.
3. Shape into a disc, wrap, and chill for 30 minutes. Roll to roughly 3 to 4 mm thick and line a 9 inch pie dish. Chill while making the filling.
4. Cook pumpkin puree over low heat for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring, until slightly thickened. Cool briefly.
5. Whisk eggs with milk, sugar, molasses, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves or allspice, and rose water if using. Stir in the pumpkin.
6. Pour into the chilled crust. Bake 15 minutes at 200C (390F), then reduce to 180C (355F) and bake 30 to 40 minutes more until the edges are set and the centre quivers slightly.
7. Cool completely before slicing.

### 9. Serve

1. Arrange the rested turkey, stuffing, and sides on a large table or island.
2. Set out cranberry sauce, pickled onions, gherkins, and beetroot for brightness.
3. Carve the turkey, ladle with gravy, and finish with whipped cream on each slice of pie.

## Chef's Notes

- Work backward from the target serving time. Bake the pie 90 minutes before the turkey finishes so it can cool and set.
- If the turkey finishes early, rest it under foil and a tea towel; it will stay hot for at least 40 minutes.
- Leftover stuffing can be baked separately in a buttered dish at 180C (355F) for 25 minutes covered plus 10 minutes uncovered.
- Skip the rose water for a more familiar pumpkin pie, or keep it for Hale's period-appropriate floral note.
