## The King's Appetite

Henry VIII was legendary for his massive appetite and love of elaborate feasts. This roast beef, served with Yorkshire pudding, represents the kind of hearty English fare that graced the Tudor court tables. The king reportedly consumed enormous quantities of meat daily—this recipe would have been just one course in a meal featuring dozens of dishes.

## Historical Context

During Henry's reign, beef was a symbol of English prosperity and strength. The wealthy could afford large cuts of meat, and the Tudor court was famous for its extravagant banquets. Yorkshire pudding, while not invented until later, represents the English tradition of using every part of the meal—the drippings from the roast were too valuable to waste.

## Instructions

### Preparing the Roast

1. **Remove the beef** from refrigeration 2 hours before cooking to bring to room temperature.

2. **Preheat oven** to 450°F (230°C).

3. **Season generously** with salt, pepper, and fresh herbs, pressing the seasonings into the meat.

4. **Roast for 20 minutes** at high heat, then reduce to 325°F (165°C).

5. **Continue roasting** until internal temperature reaches 125°F for medium-rare (about 15 minutes per pound).

### Making Yorkshire Pudding

6. **While beef rests**, increase oven temperature back to 450°F.

7. **Make batter**: Whisk eggs, milk, flour, and salt until smooth. Let rest 30 minutes.

8. **Heat drippings** in Yorkshire pudding tin until smoking hot.

9. **Pour batter** into hot drippings and bake 20-25 minutes until golden and puffed.

## Serving Like a Tudor King

Carve thick slices and serve immediately with the Yorkshire pudding, just as Henry's chefs would have presented it to the royal table.
