## Instructions

### Prepare the Strawberry Jam

1. **Prep the fruit**: Hull and chop the strawberries into small pieces.

2. **Cook the base**: Add strawberries and half the lemon juice to a heavy-bottomed pan. Cook on medium heat for about 5 minutes until the fruit starts to break down.

3. **Add sugar**: Stir in the jam sugar and increase to high heat. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent sticking.

4. **Test for setting**: Place a small plate in the freezer beforehand. Drop a small amount of jam onto the cold plate - if it doesn't run and forms a slight wrinkle when pushed with your finger, it's ready.

5. **Rest and store**: Let cool to room temperature before transferring to sterilized jars.

### Prepare the Orange Marmalade

1. **Prep the oranges**: Wash the oranges thoroughly. Cut into quarters and blend in a food processor until the rind is in very small pieces.

2. **Cook the base**: Add the processed oranges, water, and half the lemon juice to a heavy-bottomed pan. Cook on medium heat for about 5 minutes.

3. **Add sugar**: Stir in the granulated sugar and cook on medium heat for about 25 minutes, stirring regularly.

4. **Test for setting**: Use the same cold plate test as for the jam.

5. **Rest and store**: Let cool to room temperature before storing.

### Assemble the Toast

1. **Toast the bread**: Toast the wholemeal bread until golden brown.

2. **Butter generously**: Spread real butter on each slice while still warm.

3. **Add preserves**: Liberally coat two slices with strawberry jam and two with orange marmalade.

4. **Serve**: Accompany with a pot of tea to balance the sweetness.

## Chef's Notes

Peter Freestone, Freddie's personal assistant, would make 12 jars of each preserve when fruit was in season, keeping them for a full year. The homemade touch was essential to Freddie's preference for natural, unprocessed foods. The marmalade's slight bitterness from the rind and added texture makes it particularly special compared to store-bought versions.
