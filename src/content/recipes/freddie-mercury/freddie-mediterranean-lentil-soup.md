## Instructions

### Prepare the Vegetables

1. **Prep all vegetables**: Chop the onion, mince the garlic, and chop the peppers, courgette, and leek into similar-sized pieces.

### Build the Soup Base

2. **Start with aromatics**: Heat 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in your largest stock pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for about 6 minutes until softened.

3. **Add garlic**: Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.

4. **Add remaining vegetables**: Add the chopped peppers, courgette, leek, and thyme. Let everything simmer together for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

### Finish the Soup

5. **Add liquid and lentils**: Pour in the vegetable stock and add the red lentils. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes until the lentils are tender and breaking down.

6. **Final consistency**: The soup should be quite thick, more like a stew than a traditional soup - this is exactly as intended.

### Serve

7. **Garnish and serve**: Ladle into bowls and garnish with fresh black pepper, torn basil leaves, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.

8. **Accompaniments**: Serve with crusty bread rolls and butter on the side.

## Chef's Notes

This recipe is adapted straight from Peter Freestone's cookbook and perfectly suited Freddie's preference for light lunches. The soup is surprisingly wholesome and healing - every spoonful feels nourishing. Don't worry if it seems more like a stew than a soup; that's exactly how it should be. The best part is cleaning your bowl with the buttered bread!
