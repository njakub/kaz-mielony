## Pelé's Indulgent Day

Pelé grew up with straightforward Brazilian plates—rice, beans, simple stews—food that fuelled training and long days. But perhaps he enjoyed this on his more indulgent days. A beautiful example of fusion cuisine, Xinxim de Galinha is a traditional Afro-Brazilian dish from Bahia, with roots in West African cuisine brought over by enslaved people.

## Cultural & Religious Significance

In Bahia, dishes don't just feed people; they carry meaning. Xinxim is often made in Candomblé contexts—Candomblé being an Afro-Brazilian religion—where foods are connected to orixás, or deities. Oxum, the Yoruba deity associated with fresh water and gold, is linked to versions of this dish, and the silky texture and golden colour of the sauce definitely speak to that association.

## Instructions

### Prepare and Marinate the Chicken (30 minutes ahead)

1. **Clean the chicken**: Trim off any excess fat from the chicken pieces for a more attractive finish and better texture.

2. **Make the marinade**: In a large bowl, combine lime juice, crushed garlic, black pepper, and a generous amount of salt.

3. **Marinate**: Add chicken pieces and mix generously, ensuring each piece is evenly coated. Set aside for 30 minutes at room temperature.

### Prepare the Sauce Base

4. **Blend the base**: In a blender or food processor, combine peanuts, cashews, chopped onion, grated ginger, fresh coriander, and dried shrimp (if using). Add about ½ cup water and blend until smooth and creamy, like a "shrimp smoothie." Adjust water as needed for consistency.

**Note on dried shrimp**: These are potent and fishy, really packing a punch. They're traditional but can be overwhelming—use sparingly or omit entirely if preferred. They can be found at Asian supermarkets.

### Cook the Dish

5. **Heat the palm oil**: In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat the azeite de dendê (red palm oil) over medium heat. The oil should be sizzling but not smoking.

**Note on palm oil**: Red palm oil came to Brazil from West Africa during the slave trade. If solid, warm the bottle in hot water first. The oil brings distinctive color and flavor to Bahian cuisine.

6. **Brown the chicken**: Add marinated chicken pieces one by one to the hot oil. Brown on all sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. The rich red color from the palm oil will develop on the chicken.

7. **Add the base**: Pour in the blended sauce base, stirring to combine with the chicken and oil. Bring to a simmer.

8. **Long simmer**: Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45-60 minutes until the chicken is tender and cooked through. Stir occasionally.

9. **Add coconut milk**: Pour in the coconut milk and stir well. Add water as needed to achieve a sauce that lightly coats a spoon—not too thick, not too thin. Simmer for another 10-15 minutes.

10. **Adjust seasoning**: Taste and add salt as needed.

### Serve

11. **Cook rice**: Prepare plain basmati or white rice. The dish is fatty and rich, so keep the rice plain to not distract from the punchy flavor of the sauce.

12. **Plate**: Serve the xinxim over or alongside the rice, ensuring each portion gets plenty of that golden, silky sauce.

## Chef's Notes

The nuts don't come through as much as expected—most of the flavor comes from the dried shrimp, which is why many recipes omit it entirely. If you do use dried shrimp, use it in moderation. Consider using less palm oil than traditional recipes call for, and shop around for higher quality if possible, as some brands can taste artificial.

**Flavor Rating**: 6/10 - High hopes, but the dried shrimp dominates. The dish is an important cultural artifact, but requires careful balancing of the strong traditional ingredients.

**Historical Note**: Blending nuts with aromatics is a technique with African roots. Peanuts and cashews are nutty, earthy, fatty, and help emulsify the sauce—you'll see ground nuts used extensively in Bahian regional cooking.

**Alternative**: Many modern versions omit or reduce the dried shrimp and use less palm oil while still honoring the dish's Afro-Brazilian heritage. Feel free to adjust to your taste while respecting the cultural significance.
