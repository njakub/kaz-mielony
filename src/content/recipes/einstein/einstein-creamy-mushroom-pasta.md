## Instructions

### Prepare the Base

1. **Cook the pasta**: Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the linguini until al dente according to package directions. **Important**: Reserve 1 cup of the starchy pasta cooking water before draining.

2. **Prep the vegetables**: While the pasta cooks, clean and slice the mushrooms into uniform pieces. Finely chop the shallots, mince the garlic, and roughly chop the parsley.

### Build the Sauce

3. **Sauté the mushrooms**: In a large skillet over medium heat, add olive oil and 2 tbsp butter. Add the sliced mushrooms in a single layer and cook without stirring for 3-4 minutes to develop a golden crust. Then stir and continue cooking for 4-6 more minutes until they're well-browned and have released their moisture.

4. **Add aromatics**: Stir in the chopped shallots and cook for 2-3 minutes until softened. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.

5. **Create the cream base**: Reduce heat to low. Stir in the double cream and half of the chopped parsley. Let the mixture simmer gently for 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.

### Finish the Dish

6. **Enrich the sauce**: Add the remaining 2 tbsp butter and the grated pecorino romano. Stir gently until the cheese melts and creates a smooth, glossy sauce.

7. **Adjust consistency**: Add a splash of the reserved pasta water to loosen the sauce if needed—you want it to coat the pasta beautifully without being too thick.

8. **Combine pasta and sauce**: Add the drained pasta to the skillet and toss thoroughly to coat every strand. Add more pasta water gradually if needed to help the sauce cling to the pasta.

9. **Final seasoning**: Taste and adjust with salt and freshly ground black pepper. The sauce should be creamy but not heavy, with the mushrooms providing earthy depth.
