## The Genius's Simple Breakfast

Albert Einstein's daily routine included a simple yet satisfying breakfast that provided sustained energy for his groundbreaking work. This combination of honey-sweetened eggs with savory mushrooms reflects Einstein's preference for uncomplicated, nourishing meals that didn't distract from his scientific pursuits.

## Instructions

### Prep the Ingredients

1. **Prepare the mushrooms**: Clean and slice the chestnut mushrooms into even pieces.

2. **Prep aromatics**: Mince the garlic clove and roughly chop the parsley, setting aside half for garnish.

### Cook the Mushrooms

3. **Sauté mushrooms**: In a frying pan over medium heat, add 1 tbsp olive oil and 2 tbsp of the butter. Add mushrooms and a pinch of salt. Cook for 5–7 minutes until golden brown and the moisture has evaporated.

4. **Add garlic and parsley**: Stir in the minced garlic and half the chopped parsley. Cook for 1–2 minutes more until fragrant. Transfer to a plate and keep warm.

### Fry the Eggs

5. **Prepare the pan**: In the same pan, melt the remaining 2 tbsp butter over medium heat.

6. **Fry the eggs**: Crack the eggs into the pan and fry to your preference (sunny-side up works beautifully for this dish).

7. **Add honey**: Just before the eggs are done, drizzle 1 tbsp honey over the eggs in the pan and let it caramelize slightly—about 30 seconds. The honey should bubble gently and create a glossy coating.

### Assembly

8. **Toast the bread**: Toast the sourdough roll or bread slice until golden.

9. **Plate the dish**: Place the toast on a plate, top with the honey-glazed eggs, then spoon the garlic mushrooms alongside.

10. **Finish**: Sprinkle with the remaining fresh parsley and drizzle a little extra honey over the top for added sweetness.
