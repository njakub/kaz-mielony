## The Last Pharaoh's Sweet Indulgence

Cleopatra VII was renowned not only for her political acumen but also for her sophisticated palate. These honey-glazed figs represent the luxury and refinement of Ptolemaic Egypt, combining the abundant fruits of the Nile delta with precious spices from across the ancient world.

## Historical Context

In ancient Egypt, figs were symbols of fertility and abundance. Cleopatra would have enjoyed them fresh from the royal gardens in Alexandria, prepared by skilled cooks who understood the delicate balance of sweetness and spice that defined Egyptian cuisine.

## Instructions

### Preparation

1. **Preheat oven** to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Score the figs** with a deep X from top to bottom, being careful not to cut all the way through.

3. **Mix the filling**: Combine chopped pistachios, dates, and half the cinnamon.

### Assembly and Baking

4. **Stuff each fig** with the pistachio-date mixture, gently opening the scored sections.

5. **Arrange in baking dish** and drizzle with olive oil.

6. **Bake for 15 minutes** until figs are tender and slightly caramelized.

### Finishing Touch

7. **Prepare glaze**: Warm honey with rose water and remaining spices.

8. **Drizzle over hot figs** and serve immediately.

## Cleopatra's Touch

These figs would have been served on golden platters, accompanied by sweet wine from the royal vineyards. The rose water adds the floral note that Egyptian nobility prized in their desserts.
