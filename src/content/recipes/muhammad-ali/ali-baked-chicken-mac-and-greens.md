## Macaroni and Cheese

1. Heat the oven to 200C (390F). Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the macaroni for 1 minute less than the packet's al dente time. Drain and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking.
2. In a large bowl whisk together cream, milk, and eggs. Stir in garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cayenne, mustard powder, and salt.
3. Add cream cheese, diced American cheese, mozzarella, and half of each cheddar. Stir until the cheeses are evenly coated in the seasoned custard.
4. Fold in the cooled macaroni. Tip into a 23 x 33 cm baking dish and level the top. Scatter over the remaining mild and mature cheddar. Reserve while the chicken starts roasting, or cover and chill overnight.

## Baked Chicken

1. Mix sea salt, rosemary, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, black pepper, vegetable oil, and Worcestershire sauce into a loose paste. Add extra oil if needed so the rub is spreadable.
2. Spatchcock the chicken by removing the backbone with kitchen shears, then press the breastbone flat. Pat dry with paper towels.
3. Rub the seasoning paste under and over the skin. Place the chicken skin-side up on a parchment-lined tray. Roast at 200C (390F) for 15 minutes.
4. Slide the macaroni dish into the oven alongside the chicken. Continue roasting for about 45 minutes, until the chicken registers 75C (167F) in the thickest part of the thigh and the mac and cheese is deeply browned. Tent the chicken with foil and rest for 10 minutes before carving.

## Spinach and Peas

1. While the chicken rests, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add diced onion and cook for 4 minutes until translucent.
2. Stir in garlic, chilli flakes, and mint sauce; cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.
3. Add peas and water. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid nearly evaporates.
4. Add spinach by the handful, tossing until wilted. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

## Serve

Carve the chicken and plate with a generous scoop of the baked macaroni, the spinach-pea mix, and hot buttered rolls if you remembered them.
