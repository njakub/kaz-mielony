## Breadcrumbs

1. Tear the ciabatta into chunks and pulse in a food processor until very fine. Tip into a bowl and mix with chopped parsley, grated parmesan, oregano, salt, pepper, and 2 tbsp olive oil to moisten evenly.

## Veal Cutlets

1. Pound the veal escalopes between sheets of baking paper until about 0.5 cm thick. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
2. Set up a breading station with flour, beaten eggs, and the seasoned breadcrumbs. Dredge each cutlet in flour, dip in egg, then coat thoroughly in breadcrumbs, pressing to help them adhere.
3. Heat butter and 3 tbsp olive oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Fry the cutlets one at a time until golden and crisp, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.

## Rocket Salad

1. Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper to make a dressing. Toss rocket, cherry tomatoes, pine nuts, and shaved parmesan with the dressing.

## Serve

Plate each veal cutlet with a mound of rocket salad, extra parmesan, and lemon wedges. Add a Rusty Nail cocktail on the side if you want Frank's full experience.
