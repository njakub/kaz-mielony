## Marilyn's Most Challenging Meal

This was reportedly Marilyn Monroe's actual dinner preference during certain periods - a combination that truly tests one's willpower. The intense, iron-rich flavor of broiled liver paired with the sweet crunch of raw carrots created a stark contrast that Monroe apparently found both satisfying and figure-maintaining. She would eat exactly 3-5 carrot sticks, no more, no less.

This meal reflects Monroe's complicated relationship with food - choosing ingredients that were nutritionally dense but not particularly enjoyable, perhaps as a form of discipline or control.

## Instructions

### Prepare the Liver

1. **Soak if desired**: If you're new to liver, soak the slice in milk for 15-20 minutes to reduce the strong flavor, then pat dry. Monroe likely skipped this step.

2. **Season**: Pat the liver dry and season both sides generously with salt and pepper.

3. **Preheat broiler**: Set your broiler to high and position the rack about 4 inches from the heat source.

### Prepare the Carrots

4. **Wash and peel**: Thoroughly wash and peel the carrots.

5. **Cut into sticks**: Cut exactly 3-5 carrots into stick shapes, about 4 inches long and 1/2 inch thick. Monroe was reportedly specific about this number.

6. **Chill**: Place carrot sticks in ice water for extra crispness while the liver cooks.

### Cook the Liver

7. **Oil the pan**: Brush a broiler pan or cast iron skillet with butter or oil.

8. **Broil**: Place liver on the pan and broil for 3-4 minutes on the first side.

9. **Flip**: Turn the liver and broil for another 2-3 minutes. Liver should be cooked through but still slightly pink in the center.

10. **Rest**: Let the liver rest for 1 minute before serving.

### Serve

11. **Plate simply**: Place the broiled liver on a plate alongside the raw carrot sticks.

12. **Eat as Monroe did**: Alternate bites of the rich, mineral-flavored liver with the sweet crunch of raw carrot.

## Marilyn's Discipline

This meal represents Monroe's attempt at nutritional discipline - liver being one of the most nutrient-dense foods available, providing iron, vitamin A, and protein. The raw carrots added fiber and natural sweetness while keeping calories low.

The combination is admittedly challenging, requiring a strong constitution and perhaps reflecting Monroe's complex relationship with food and her body image during Hollywood's golden age.

**Note**: Ensure liver is from a reputable source and cooked to at least 160°F (71°C) internal temperature for food safety.
