## Marilyn's Real Morning Ritual

This was Marilyn Monroe's actual breakfast routine, documented in her personal notes and interviews. Far from the glamorous champagne breakfast myth, Monroe's real morning meal was this simple protein-rich drink paired with vitamins. She believed this combination gave her sustained energy and helped maintain her figure while providing the nutrition she needed for long filming days.

The warm milk made the raw eggs more palatable while the protein helped stabilize her energy levels throughout busy Hollywood mornings.

## Instructions

### Preparation

1. **Warm the milk**: Pour the milk into a small saucepan and gently heat over low-medium heat until warm but not hot (around 100-110°F/38-43°C). Don't let it boil or get too hot.

2. **Test temperature**: The milk should feel comfortably warm when you dip your clean finger in it - like a baby's bottle temperature.

### Mixing the Drink

3. **Crack the eggs**: While the milk warms, crack the two eggs into your drinking glass, being careful to remove any shell pieces.

4. **Whisk lightly**: Use a fork to lightly whisk the eggs in the glass, just enough to break the yolks and combine.

5. **Add warm milk**: Slowly pour the warm milk into the glass with the eggs, whisking gently as you pour to prevent the eggs from cooking.

6. **Optional seasoning**: Add a tiny pinch of salt if desired, though Monroe typically drank it plain.

### Serving

7. **Take vitamin**: Take your multivitamin with the drink, just as Marilyn did.

8. **Drink immediately**: Consume right away while still warm for the best texture and temperature.

## Marilyn's Approach

Monroe reportedly drank this every morning as part of her beauty and health routine. She believed the raw eggs gave her protein for energy and healthy skin, while the warm milk was comforting and helped settle her often-nervous stomach before facing the cameras.

**Safety Note**: This recipe contains raw eggs. Use only the freshest, highest-quality eggs, preferably pasteurized. Avoid if pregnant, elderly, or immunocompromised.
