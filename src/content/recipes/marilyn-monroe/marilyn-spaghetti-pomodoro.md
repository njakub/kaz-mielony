## Marilyn's Simple Approach

This was Marilyn Monroe's actual lunch preference - a surprisingly simple spaghetti dish made with just blended tomatoes and good olive oil. No cheese, no butter, no cream. Just pure, clean flavors that she found both satisfying and figure-friendly. The simplicity of this dish reflects Monroe's appreciation for uncomplicated, honest food.

## Instructions

### Prepare the Tomato Sauce

1. **Prepare tomatoes**: If using fresh tomatoes, bring a pot of water to boil. Score an X on the bottom of each tomato and blanch for 30 seconds, then transfer to ice water. Peel and roughly chop.

2. **Blend tomatoes**: Place the tomatoes (fresh or canned) in a blender and blend until completely smooth. Strain if you prefer an ultra-smooth sauce.

3. **Heat olive oil**: In a large skillet, warm 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. If using garlic, add it now and cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.

### Cook the Pasta

4. **Boil water**: Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil.

5. **Cook spaghetti**: Add the spaghetti and cook according to package directions until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water before draining.

### Combine and Serve

6. **Add tomato blend**: Pour the blended tomatoes into the skillet with oil. Season with salt and simmer for 8-10 minutes until slightly thickened.

7. **Combine pasta**: Add the drained spaghetti to the tomato sauce. Toss gently, adding pasta water if needed to help the sauce coat the pasta.

8. **Final touch**: Drizzle with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and add fresh basil leaves if desired.

9. **Serve immediately**: Enjoy while hot, just as Marilyn preferred.

## Marilyn's Choice

Monroe reportedly chose this simple preparation because it satisfied her pasta cravings without the heavy richness of butter or cheese. The pure tomato flavor, enhanced only by good olive oil, became one of her regular lunch options during her Hollywood years.

The dish's simplicity also meant she could control exactly what went into her meal - important for someone constantly under scrutiny about her appearance.
