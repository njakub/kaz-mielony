## Gangster Comfort Food

This silky walnut pasta echoes the kind of home-style cooking Al Capone grew up eating in his Neapolitan household before he became the most notorious mob boss in Chicago. Ground walnuts toast in garlicky olive oil, chilli brings a whisper of heat, and starchy pasta water turns it all into a creamy sauce without a drop of dairy.

## Instructions

### Part 1 – Prep the Story and the Pasta

1. **Boil the pasta**: Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Drop in the spaghetti and cook until just shy of al dente. Reserve at least 300ml of the pasta water before draining.
2. **Set the scene**: While the pasta cooks, blitz most of the walnuts into a fine meal (a food processor works best) and chop the remaining handful into chunky pieces for later.

### Part 2 – Cook Like Capone

3. **Infuse the oil**: In a wide skillet over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add minced garlic and stir constantly until it turns pale gold—about 1 minute. Sprinkle in chilli flakes and cook for 30 seconds.
4. **Toast the walnuts**: Add the ground walnuts to the pan. Stir for 2 minutes until they smell nutty and begin to toast. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
5. **Build the sauce**: Ladle in 150ml hot pasta water and stir vigorously. The starchy water should emulsify with the oil and walnuts into a loose, glossy sauce. Add more water a splash at a time if it looks tight.

### Part 3 – Finish and Serve

6. **Coat the pasta**: Add the drained spaghetti to the skillet. Toss continuously over low heat until every strand is coated and the sauce clings. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
7. **Freshen it up**: Scatter in chopped parsley and toss again to weave the freshness through the sauce. Fold in the chopped walnuts for crunch.
8. **Shower with cheese**: Remove from the heat. Sprinkle in parmesan and toss one final time so it melts into a silky sheen. Finish with an optional drizzle of olive oil.
9. **Plate and serve**: Twirl portions onto warm plates. Dust with extra parmesan and a pinch of chilli flakes if you like things hotter. Serve immediately, ideally with a glass of red wine hidden under the table.

## Chef's Notes

- **Walnut texture**: Grinding most of the nuts keeps the sauce creamy, while a small portion left chunky gives bite—mirroring the smooth talk and sharp edges of Capone himself.
- **Heat level**: Capone supposedly liked a little heat. Start with half a teaspoon of chilli flakes and add more to taste.
- **Make ahead**: Toast and grind the walnuts in advance, then store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
- **Add protein**: Crisp pancetta or a splash of anchovy oil fits the era, but the classic version stays meat-free.
- **S tier potential**: Simple ingredients, bold flavour, a touch of class—and a reminder that even gangsters needed comfort food.
