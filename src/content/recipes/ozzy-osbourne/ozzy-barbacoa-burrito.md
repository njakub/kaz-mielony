## The Prince of Darkness's Go-To

Ozzy Osbourne was a self-confessed 'BURRITO MAN' who lived for his local Chipotle in Los Angeles. He called it his 'favourite burrito joint' and joked about eating there twice a day. Thanks to footage from The Osbournes reality show, we know his exact order: white rice, pinto beans, barbacoa beef, sour cream, cheese, and medium salsa.

This is that burrito - rich, smokey barbacoa braised with four types of dried chillies, tangy tomatillo salsa, creamy beans, and fresh cilantro-lime rice all wrapped up in a flour tortilla.

## Instructions

### Part I - Barbacoa Beef

1. **Toast the chillies**: Deseed and tear the pasilla, guajillo, ancho, and arbol chillies into pieces. Place in a dry pot over medium heat and toast for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until fragrant. Don't let them burn.

2. **Rehydrate**: Pour 250ml of the beef stock over the toasted chillies, cover, and microwave for 5 minutes (or simmer on the stove). Let them soften completely.

3. **Prep aromatics**: While chillies soak, slice the onion, peel the garlic cloves, and chop the chipotles in adobo into a paste.

4. **Prep the meat**: Cut brisket into 6-8cm chunks, trimming only hard fat and silverskin. Leave most fat intact - it renders during braising for tender, juicy meat.

5. **Brown the beef**: Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown beef chunks in batches (don't overcrowd), about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove and set aside.

6. **Cook aromatics**: In the same pot, add sliced onion and garlic. Cook for 5 minutes until softened, scraping up the fond (browned bits). Add chipotle paste, cumin, oregano, and crushed cloves. Stir for 1 minute.

7. **Make the sauce**: Pour in remaining 500ml beef stock and bring to a simmer. Add the soaked chillies with their soaking liquid to a blender along with the onion-stock mixture. Blend until completely smooth - no lumps.

8. **Braise**: Return beef to the pot and pour the blended sauce over top. Stir to coat. Bring to a boil, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and transfer to a 160°C (320°F) oven. Braise for 4-6 hours, stirring occasionally, until beef is probe-tender and shreds easily with a spoon.

9. **Shred**: Remove from oven. Use two forks (or a spoon) to shred the beef directly in the braising liquid. It should fall apart effortlessly.

### Part II - Tomatillo Salsa

10. **Char the vegetables**: Preheat your grill/broiler to high. Place tomatillos (drained if canned), jalapeños, onion chunks, and garlic cloves on a baking tray. Grill for 8-10 minutes until vegetables have some nice charring.

11. **Blend the salsa**: Add charred vegetables and tomatillos to a blender. Add fresh coriander and lime juice. Blend until smooth. Season with salt to taste. The salsa should be bright, tangy, and slightly spicy.

### Part III - Pinto Beans

12. **Cook aromatics**: Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add diced onion and cook for 5 minutes until softened. Add garlic paste and chipotle paste, stir for 1 minute.

13. **Add spices**: Stir in cumin, oregano, and cinnamon. Add tomato puree and stir well.

14. **Add beans**: Pour in vegetable stock to create a paste, then add the drained pinto beans. Bring to a simmer.

15. **Thicken**: Cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring frequently, until liquid reduces. Mash some beans against the side of the pan and stir through to thicken the sauce naturally.

### Part IV - Cilantro-Lime Rice

16. **Season the rice**: In a large bowl, combine warm cooked rice, melted butter, lime zest, lime juice, and chopped coriander. Mix well. The rice should be fluffy, fresh, and fragrant.

### Part V - Assemble the Burritos

17. **Warm tortillas**: Heat tortillas in a dry pan or microwave until warm and pliable.

18. **Layer strategically**: Place tortilla on a flat surface. Start with a layer of cilantro-lime rice in the center (acts as a barrier to prevent sogginess). Add a generous spoonful of pinto beans. Pile on shredded barbacoa beef. Grate over mild cheddar cheese. Spoon on tomatillo salsa. Add a dollop of sour cream.

19. **Wrap tightly**: Fold in the sides of the tortilla, then roll from the bottom up tightly, tucking as you go.

20. **Optional - toast**: For a crispy exterior, heat the wrapped burrito seam-side down in a dry pan or griddle for 1-2 minutes per side.

## Chef's Notes

**On the beef**: Brisket is ideal for this long braise - the fat and collagen break down into gelatin, making it juicy and shreddable. Chuck roast or short rib work well too, or use a mixture.

**On the chillies**: Toasting dried chillies before rehydrating brings out their aromatics and removes bitterness. You get depth without harshness. Don't skip this step.

**On the beans**: Chipotle's pinto beans used to contain bacon but went vegetarian nationwide in 2013. If you want bacon, fry some lardons with the onions.

**On the salsa**: Fresh tomatillos are ideal but can be hard to find. Canned work perfectly fine - just drain them first.

**On assembly**: The rice acts as a crucial barrier between the tortilla and wet ingredients. Don't skip it or your burrito will get soggy.

**Make ahead**: The barbacoa beef actually improves overnight. Make it a day ahead, refrigerate, then reheat gently. The beans and salsa can also be made ahead.
