## Bizcocho: Twice-Baked Survival

The very word "biscuit" comes from Latin—bis coctus, "twice-cooked". There is evidence of soldiers in ancient Rome carrying a hard dry ration called buccellatum, whilst Richard the Lionheart set out with ships loaded with "biskit" on the Third Crusade in 1190.

On Spanish ships, biscuits were called bizcocho—or "twice-baked"—and were issued by the sack. The daily backbone for Columbus's crew was this biscuit. It kept for months, stacked neatly in the bread room, and—if they could soften it—filled them up.

Of course, longevity has a price. And that price is weevils. On the worst voyages the biscuit disintegrated into powder and pests. One of Magellan's men, Antonio Pigafetta, wrote that the crew ate "biscuit, which was no longer biscuit, but powder of biscuits swarming with worms."

## Instructions

### Make the Hardtack

1. **Preheat oven**: Heat oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Mix the dough**: In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Gradually add water, mixing until a stiff dough forms. You want it just barely workable—this isn't bread.

3. **Roll out**: Roll the dough to about ¼ inch thickness on a floured surface.

4. **Cut and dock**: Cut into 3x3 inch squares. Use a skewer or fork to pierce holes across the entire surface—this prevents air pockets and helps with drying.

5. **First bake**: Place on ungreased baking sheets and bake for 30 minutes.

6. **Flip and continue**: Flip the biscuits and bake for another 30 minutes until completely hard.

7. **Dry out**: Turn off the oven and leave the biscuits inside as it cools, or leave them out in a dry place for several days until rock-hard. They should be completely dried through.

### The Admiral's Breakfast

8. **Soften the hardtack**: Pour red wine into a shallow bowl. Break the hardtack into manageable pieces and soak in wine for 5-10 minutes until softened enough to chew without breaking teeth.

9. **Arrange the spread**: On a wooden board, arrange the softened hardtack pieces, wedges of manchego cheese, slices of ham, and olives.

10. **Serve with wine**: Pour a generous glass of red wine—both for soaking any remaining hardtack and for drinking.

## Chef's Notes

Pre-soak: tooth-shattering. Post-soak: barely bread, but dunked in hot broth or wine it turns from punishment into fuel. Cheese upgrades morale by 50%.

This breakfast spread wouldn't reach the lower deck—as admiral, Columbus could dip into his private stores, at least in the first weeks. The combination of protein from cheese and ham, fat, salt from the olives, and the carbohydrates from softened biscuit provided essential nutrition.

**Historical Note**: Museums actually teach you to bake hardtack this way, and period accounts say sailors broke it up and soaked it in "whatever liquid was at hand" to soften it for consumption. The biscuits needed to be rock-hard to resist mold and time during months at sea.

**Storage**: Properly dried hardtack can last for years in a dry environment—exactly as it was designed to do in ship's bread rooms.
