## From Warrior Fuel to National Dish

Maize arrived in Southern Africa via Portuguese traders in the 1500s, and Zulu communities adopted it, creating isitambu as a nourishing, communal meal. While it was once seen as a poor man's food, it evolved into a valued comfort food, eventually becoming known as the national dish of South Africa.

This recipe gives you both versions: the authentic warrior fuel that kept Shaka's armies going, and the modern comfort food beloved across South Africa.

## Instructions

### Preparation (Night Before)

1. **Soak overnight**: Place samp and beans in separate bowls. Cover with plenty of water and soak overnight (8-12 hours).

### Authentic Version

2. **Drain and rinse**: Drain and rinse both samp and beans thoroughly.

3. **Cook together**: In a large pot, combine samp, beans, and enough water to cover by 2 inches. Add 1 tsp salt.

4. **Long simmer**: Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 1.5-2 hours until both samp and beans are tender. Add more water as needed.

5. **Final seasoning**: Add remaining salt to taste. The texture should be soft but not mushy.

6. **Serve authentic**: Serve half as is - plain, earthy, and exactly as Shaka's warriors would have eaten it.

### Modern Version

7. **Prepare aromatics**: Heat oil in a separate large pot. Saut√© chopped onion and bell pepper until softened, about 5 minutes.

8. **Add garlic and spice**: Stir in minced garlic and curry powder. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

9. **Combine**: Add half of the cooked samp and beans mixture to the aromatics.

10. **Enhanced cooking**: Pour in beef stock and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thick and flavorful.

11. **Final touches**: Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

### Serve

12. **Compare both versions**: Serve the authentic version alongside the modern version to experience the evolution of this dish.

## Chef's Notes

The authentic version tastes exactly how it looks - plain, earthy, not unpleasant, but definitely more about fuel than flavor. Perfect warrior food that would keep you going through a long day.

The modern version is a completely different story: rich, colorful, hearty - almost like a baked-beans curry. Both tell important stories about survival, evolution, and the transformation of simple ingredients into comfort food.
