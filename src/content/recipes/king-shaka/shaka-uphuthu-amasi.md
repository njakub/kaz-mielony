## The Heart of Zulu Cuisine

Amasi was at the heart of Zulu cuisine, prepared by letting fresh cow milk ferment naturally in a calabash or cowhide bag. No starter culture, no fridge — it soured from the air and from the vessel itself, creating this tangy, slightly thickened milk that was eaten with pap or drunk straight.

There's even a Zulu saying — 'the calabash of sour milk broke' — meaning all hopes are gone. That's how central this food was. As Nelson Mandela wrote in his autobiography, amasi was one of his favorite foods, representing not just nutrition but cultural identity.

## Instructions

### Prepare Amasi (3-5 days ahead)

1. **Traditional method**: Pour fresh, unpasteurized milk into a clean calabash or glass jar. Cover with cloth and leave at room temperature for 3-5 days until naturally soured and slightly thickened.

2. **Modern alternative**: Use store-bought amasi or cultured buttermilk for convenience and food safety.

### Make Uphuthu

3. **Prepare the pot**: In a heavy-bottomed pot, bring 2 cups of water and salt to a boil.

4. **Add maize meal**: Gradually add the maize meal while stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming.

5. **Initial cooking**: Reduce heat to low and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

6. **Steam cooking**: Cover the pot and let it steam for 15-20 minutes. The uphuthu should be crumbly, not smooth like porridge.

7. **Final texture**: Stir gently with a fork to break up any large clumps. The texture should be light and crumbly, not creamy.

### Serve

8. **Traditional presentation**: Serve uphuthu in bowls with amasi on the side for dipping or pouring over.

9. **Eating method**: Take spoonfuls of uphuthu and dip into or mix with the tangy amasi.

## Chef's Notes

The uphuthu should be crumbly like couscous, not smooth like porridge. The amasi adds the essential tangy, refreshing punch that transforms this simple grain into a satisfying breakfast. This combination provided sustained energy for Zulu warriors throughout their demanding days.

**Food Safety Note**: When making traditional amasi, ensure all equipment is thoroughly clean. For modern food safety, consider using store-bought cultured buttermilk or amasi.
