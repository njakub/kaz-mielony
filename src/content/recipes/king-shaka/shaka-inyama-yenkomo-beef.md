## Cattle as Wealth and Power

In Shaka's time, cattle were wealth, and slaughtering one was a major event, reserved for ceremonies, rewards, or celebrations. Every cut of the meat had meaning: inyama yenhloko (head meat) was reserved for men at ceremonies, younger men received organ meat, while elders and leaders were given the choicest portions.

The way meat was shared wasn't just about food — it was about reinforcing hierarchy, power, and social order within the Zulu kingdom. Nothing was wasted, and everything had its place in the social structure.

## Instructions

### Prepare the Beef

1. **Cut the meat**: Cut beef into large chunks, keeping some bone-in pieces for authentic flavor.

2. **Season simply**: Season with salt, staying true to the limited seasonings available in Shaka's time.

### Authentic Version

3. **Start cooking**: In a large, heavy pot, place half the beef with chopped onion. Add enough water to just cover.

4. **Long simmer**: Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce to low heat. Cover and simmer for 1.5-2 hours until meat is very tender.

5. **Thicken traditionally**: Mix maize flour with a little cold water to make a slurry. Stir into the pot to thicken the cooking liquid.

6. **Season and serve**: Add salt to taste. The result should be simple, plain, but with the pure flavor of beef shining through.

### Modern Version

7. **Sear the meat**: In a separate large pot, brown the remaining beef pieces on all sides to develop flavor.

8. **Build the base**: Add remaining onion, garlic, and tomato paste. Cook until fragrant, about 3 minutes.

9. **Add liquids**: Pour in chopped tomatoes and enough water to cover the meat.

10. **Season richly**: Add bay leaves, cloves, nutmeg, black pepper, and fresh herbs.

11. **Add vegetables**: Stir in chopped carrots for color and sweetness.

12. **Braise slowly**: Cover and simmer for 1.5-2 hours until meat is fall-apart tender and sauce is rich.

13. **Final adjustments**: Taste and adjust seasoning. Remove bay leaves before serving.

### Serve

14. **Present both**: Serve both versions side by side to show the evolution from ceremonial simplicity to modern comfort food.

## Chef's Notes

The authentic version is surprisingly good - plain, yes, but the flavor of the beef really shines through, and the maize thickener gives it a nice body. Simple, hearty, and far more enjoyable than expected.

The modern version feels familiar and comforting - rich, warming, and exactly what you'd expect from a beef stew today. Both are excellent in their own way, but they tell very different stories: one of survival and ceremony, the other of evolution and comfort.

**Cultural Note**: In traditional Zulu culture, different cuts were distributed according to age, gender, and social status. This meal represented not just nutrition, but the entire social structure of the kingdom.
