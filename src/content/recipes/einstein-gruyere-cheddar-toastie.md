## Instructions

### Preparation

1. **Grate the cheeses**: If not already grated, shred both the Gruyère and cheddar cheese. Mixing them in a bowl allows for even distribution.

### Assembly

3. **Add the mustard**: Spread the Dijon mustard evenly on the top slice of bread. The mustard not only adds flavor but helps bind the cheese to the bread.

4. **Layer the cheese**: Pile the mixed Gruyère and cheddar onto the bottom slice.

5. **Complete the sandwich**: Top with the second slice of bread, pressing gently to help everything adhere.

### Cooking

7. **Heat the pan**: Place a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat.

8. **First side**: Place the sandwich in the heated pan and cook for 2-3 minutes until the bottom is golden brown and crispy.

9. **Flip and butter**: Using a spatula, flip the sandwich and spread a light layer of butter on to the toasted side. After 2 minutes, repeat with the other side.

10. **Keep flipping**: flip every 15-30sec to stop the bread from burning while allowing the cheese to melt. The sandwich is ready when both sides are golden brown and the cheese is fully melted.

### Finishing

11. **Rest briefly**: Remove from heat and let the sandwich rest for about 1 minute. This allows the molten cheese to settle slightly, preventing it from running out when cut.

12. **Slice and serve**: Cut diagonally with a sharp knife and serve immediately while the cheese is still beautifully molten.
