## The Genius's Simple Breakfast

Albert Einstein's daily routine included a simple yet satisfying breakfast that provided sustained energy for his groundbreaking work. This combination of honey-sweetened eggs with savory mushrooms reflects Einstein's preference for uncomplicated, nourishing meals that didn't distract from his scientific pursuits.

## Historical Context

Einstein was known for his modest eating habits, often preferring simple, wholesome foods over elaborate cuisine. This breakfast dish represents the kind of meal he might have enjoyed in his Princeton home, combining protein-rich eggs with the natural sweetness of honey—a combination that would have reminded him of traditional German breakfast fare from his youth.

The use of honey in savory dishes was common in Central European cooking, and Einstein's appreciation for such combinations reflects his cultural background and practical approach to nutrition.

## Instructions

### Prep the Ingredients

1. **Prepare the mushrooms**: Clean and slice the chestnut mushrooms into even pieces.

2. **Prep aromatics**: Mince the garlic clove and roughly chop the parsley, setting aside half for garnish.

### Cook the Mushrooms

3. **Sauté mushrooms**: In a frying pan over medium heat, add 1 tbsp olive oil and 2 tbsp of the butter. Add mushrooms and a pinch of salt. Cook for 5–7 minutes until golden brown and the moisture has evaporated.

4. **Add garlic and parsley**: Stir in the minced garlic and half the chopped parsley. Cook for 1–2 minutes more until fragrant. Transfer to a plate and keep warm.

### Fry the Eggs

5. **Prepare the pan**: In the same pan, melt the remaining 2 tbsp butter over medium heat.

6. **Fry the eggs**: Crack the eggs into the pan and fry to your preference (sunny-side up works beautifully for this dish).

7. **Add honey**: Just before the eggs are done, drizzle 1 tbsp honey over the eggs in the pan and let it caramelize slightly—about 30 seconds. The honey should bubble gently and create a glossy coating.

### Assembly

8. **Toast the bread**: Toast the sourdough roll or bread slice until golden.

9. **Plate the dish**: Place the toast on a plate, top with the honey-glazed eggs, then spoon the garlic mushrooms alongside.

10. **Finish**: Sprinkle with the remaining fresh parsley and drizzle a little extra honey over the top for added sweetness.

## Einstein's Touch

This dish embodies Einstein's philosophy of elegant simplicity—few ingredients combined thoughtfully to create something greater than the sum of its parts. The sweet-savory balance would have appealed to his scientific mind, which appreciated harmony and proportion in all things.

Serve immediately while the eggs are still warm and the honey glaze is glistening, just as Einstein would have enjoyed it before settling into a morning of contemplating the mysteries of the universe.
