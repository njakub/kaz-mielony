## Rolady Slaskie

1. Trim the beef and pound each slice between sheets of baking paper until roughly 1/2 cm thick. Season lightly with salt and pepper.
2. Spread spicy mustard over each piece. Lay bacon, onion, and pickle batons along one edge. Roll up tightly and secure with kitchen twine or toothpicks.
3. Heat oil in a heavy pan over medium high heat. Brown the roulades on all sides in batches. Return all pieces to the pan.
4. Pour in 1 litre water, add bay leaves, allspice, and the reserved bacon skin. Bring to a simmer, cover, and transfer to a 180C (355F) oven. Braise for 90 minutes, turning once, until tender.
5. Remove roulades to a warm plate. Strain the braising liquid into a saucepan and reduce by half. Thicken with a slurry of 1 tbsp flour mixed with cold water if desired, then season to taste.

## Braised Red Cabbage

1. In a large pot combine shredded cabbage, 500 ml water, bay leaves, and allspice. Bring to a simmer and cook over medium heat until the water evaporates and the cabbage softens, about 25 minutes.
2. In a separate pan fry diced bacon over medium heat until rendered. Add onion and cook until golden.
3. Stir vinegar and sugar into the cabbage, then fold through the bacon and onion mixture. Season with salt and pepper.

## Kluski Slaskie Dumplings

1. Boil potatoes in salted water until tender. Drain, then pass through a ricer into a bowl. Allow steam to escape for a few minutes.
2. Smooth the mashed potatoes into an even layer in the bowl. Divide visually into four quarters. Remove one quarter of potato and replace with the same volume of potato flour.
3. Add the egg, salt, and a pinch of pepper. Knead gently until a smooth dough forms.
4. Roll portions of dough into 2 cm thick ropes. Cut into equal pieces, roll into balls, and press a thumb indent into the centre of each dumpling.
5. Boil in salted water until the dumplings float, then cook for 1 minute more. Transfer to a tray and keep warm.

## Serve

Plate two roulades per person with spoonfuls of braised cabbage and dumplings. Finish with the reduced gravy and a crack of black pepper.
