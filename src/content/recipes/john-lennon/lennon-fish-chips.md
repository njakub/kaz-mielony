## Liverpool's Comfort Constant

For a post-war Liverpool kid like John, fish & chips was the comforting constant you could still get. Wartime policy explains why it stuck: fish and potatoes weren't rationed, so a hot paper parcel became a habit people carried into the 1950s and 60s—the Beatles' teenage years. The band even left evidence on film: one of the 1965 "I Feel Fine" promos shows them enjoying fish & chips between takes.

## Instructions

### Prepare the Mushy Peas (Night Before)

1. **Soak the peas**: Place dried marrowfat peas in a bowl, cover with water, add bicarbonate of soda, and soak overnight.

### Make the Mushy Peas

2. **Cook the peas**: Drain and rinse the soaked peas. Place in a pot with fresh water to cover by 2 inches.

3. **Simmer**: Bring to a boil, then simmer for 45-60 minutes until peas break down into a soft, mushy consistency.

4. **Season**: Add salt to taste and a knob of butter if desired. Keep warm.

### Prepare the Curry Sauce

5. **Make a roux**: In a small saucepan, melt butter and whisk in flour. Cook for 1 minute.

6. **Add curry**: Whisk in curry powder and cook for another minute until fragrant.

7. **Add liquid**: Gradually whisk in stock until smooth. Add vinegar and simmer for 5 minutes until thickened. Season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.

**Alternative**: Simply prepare a packet curry sauce mix according to package instructions - much easier and just as authentic to the chippy experience!

### Prepare the Chips

8. **Cut potatoes**: Peel and cut Maris Pipers into chunky chips, about ½ inch thick.

9. **First fry**: Heat oil to 325°F (160°C). Fry chips for 4-5 minutes until just tender but not colored. Remove and drain.

### Make the Batter and Fish

10. **Mix batter**: In a bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper. Gradually whisk in cold beer until smooth.

11. **Heat oil**: Increase oil temperature to 375°F (190°C).

12. **Batter fish**: Pat fish dry and dip into batter, letting excess drip off.

### Final Cooking

13. **Fry fish**: Carefully lower battered fish into hot oil. Fry for 4-5 minutes until golden and crispy.

14. **Second fry chips**: While fish cooks, return chips to oil for final 2-3 minutes until golden and crispy.

15. **Drain**: Remove fish and chips, drain on paper towels, and season with salt immediately.

### Serve

16. **Traditional presentation**: Serve fish and chips with mushy peas and curry sauce on the side. Traditionally wrapped in paper for authenticity.

## Chef's Notes

Most deep-fried things taste good, and this is no exception. The curry sauce is definitely a must on the side, even if not strictly traditional for some.

The double-fry method for chips ensures they're fluffy inside and crispy outside—just like the best chip shops. The beer batter should be light and crispy, providing the perfect contrast to the flaky fish inside.
