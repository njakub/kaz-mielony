## The Disputed Final Meal

It's often reported that John Lennon's final meal was exactly this — corned beef on rye from New York's Stage Deli, hours before he was killed on December 8, 1980. The claim originates from James L. Dickerson's book "Last Suppers," which cites Stage Deli manager Gill Kashkin as the source.

But here's why people dispute it: reputable timelines of John's last day say he and Yoko talked about stopping at Stage Deli after a night session at the Record Plant—then decided to go home to check on Sean instead. If they didn't go, that would make the Stage Deli meal unlikely to be his last.

Regardless of its historical accuracy, this represents Lennon's New York period perfectly—a classic deli sandwich from his adopted city.

## Instructions

### Make the Corned Beef (5 Days Ahead)

1. **Prepare the brine**: In a large pot, combine water, kosher salt, brown sugar, and pink curing salt. Stir until dissolved.

2. **Add aromatics**: Add garlic cloves, bay leaves, coriander seeds, peppercorns, mustard seeds, and ground cloves to the brine.

3. **Brine the brisket**: Submerge the brisket completely in the brine. Refrigerate for 5 days, turning the meat once daily.

### Cook the Corned Beef

4. **Remove from brine**: After 5 days, remove the brisket from the brine and rinse thoroughly under cold water.

5. **Gentle boil**: Place the brisket in a large pot and cover with fresh water. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to maintain a very gentle simmer.

6. **Long cook**: Cook for 2.5-3 hours, or until the meat is fork-tender and easily shreds. The internal temperature should reach 160°F (71°C).

7. **Cool and slice**: Let the corned beef cool slightly, then slice against the grain into thin slices.

### Assemble the Sandwich

8. **Prepare the bread**: If desired, lightly butter the rye bread slices.

9. **Add mustard**: Spread Dijon mustard generously on one or both slices of bread.

10. **Layer the meat**: Pile the sliced corned beef generously on one slice of bread. Don't be shy—New York delis are known for their generous portions.

11. **Complete the sandwich**: Top with the second slice of bread and press gently.

12. **Serve**: Cut diagonally and serve with dill pickles on the side, just like at a proper NY deli.

## Chef's Notes

The meat should be incredibly tender and salty but in a very good way. The 5-day brine transforms tough brisket into something special. If beef wasn't so expensive, you'd want to throw another brisket into the brine tomorrow.

**Time-Saving Alternative**: If you don't have 5 days to make your own, high-quality deli corned beef works perfectly for this sandwich. The key is getting good rye bread and not skimping on the mustard.

**Historical Note**: Whether or not this was truly John's final meal, it represents his New York years perfectly—a time when he embraced American culture while maintaining his British sensibilities.
