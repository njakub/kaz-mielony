## A King-Sized Appetite

Henry VIII was legendary for many things—his six wives, breaking from Rome, and his absolutely massive appetite. Historical records show he consumed between 4,000-5,000 calories per day, and beef was his absolute favorite.

## The Tudor Table

Tudor banquets were theatrical events. This roast beef would have been just one of dozens of dishes served simultaneously, creating a display of wealth and power that reinforced Henry's authority.

## Cooking Challenges

The biggest challenge was scaling down recipes designed to feed a royal court. Original Tudor recipes called for entire sides of beef—we had to work backwards from serving sizes that could feed modern families while maintaining authentic flavors.

## Historical Accuracy vs. Modern Safety

We made some concessions to modern food safety while preserving the essence of Tudor cooking. The original cooking methods and times have been adjusted for today's ovens and meat standards.

## The Yorkshire Pudding Question

While Yorkshire pudding as we know it wasn't invented until after Henry's time, the concept of using drippings for bread-like accompaniments was well established in Tudor kitchens. Our version bridges historical accuracy with familiar flavors.
