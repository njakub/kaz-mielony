## Introduction

Today on Kaz Cooks History, we're eating like Christopher Columbus. A famed explorer and admiral, Columbus set sail with three caravels and a crew of roughly ninety men to cross the Atlantic and discover the "New World". But how did they stay alive out there?

Equipped with a pantry stocked to survive the harsh conditions at sea, Columbus and his men sustained themselves on rations of ship's biscuit, salt meat, salt cod, legumes, oil, vinegar, cheese, and wine, stopping off at La Gomera on Thursday 6 September 1492 to top up on water, wood and meat.

While Columbus likely ate local foods whilst ashore, this episode focuses on his seafaring dietâ€”the meals that kept an entire crew alive for months at sea.
