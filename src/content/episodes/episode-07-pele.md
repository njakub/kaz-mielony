## Introduction

Born Edson Arantes do Nascimento on 23 October 1940 in Três Corações, Brazil, Pelé is widely considered to be the greatest football player of all time. His football career started at fifteen when he joined Santos, before joining the Brazil national team a year later at sixteen.

Pelé then went on to become the youngest player to win a World Cup, the only player to win three World Cups (1958, 1962, 1970), and the Guinness world record holder for most career goals—over 1,000 career goals. In short, the man was a legend.
