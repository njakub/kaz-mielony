## Rock History on a Plate

Today on Kaz Cooks History we're cooking rock history with a stacked, cheesy beef burrito Ozzy Osbourne loved. Born in Birmingham, Ozzy fronted Black Sabbath, pioneered heavy metal, and launched a huge solo career, before later showing up in millions of living rooms via reality show The Osbournes.

## The Burrito Man

Across all that success, Ozzy kept simple habits, and one of them was grabbing a burrito from his local Chipotle in L.A. Ozzy was a self-confessed 'BURRITO MAN', and Chipotle was his 'favourite burrito joint'. He even joked about eating there twice a day.

## The Documented Order

Thanks to footage captured on an episode of The Osbournes, his exact order is documented: white rice, pinto beans, barbacoa beef, sour cream, cheese, and medium salsa. Which makes recreating it all the easier.

## About Chipotle

Chipotle was founded by Steve Ells in Denver in 1993, inspired by mission-style burritos in San Francisco. A pioneer in the fast-casual space, for a slightly higher price it offered a fresher, higher quality product in a setup similar to a fast-food joint. The restaurant was an instant hit, selling 1,000 burritos in its first day. It expanded rapidly and McDonald's became a major investor in 1998. Today it's the 10th most popular restaurant in the US by revenue, bringing in $8,600m.

## The Recipe

This burrito is built around slow-braised barbacoa beef infused with four types of dried chillies, chipotle in adobo, and aromatic spices. The tangy tomatillo salsa cuts through the richness, while cilantro-lime rice and creamy pinto beans round out this legendary wrap. It's a winner - no wonder the Prince of Darkness wolfed down two of these a day.
