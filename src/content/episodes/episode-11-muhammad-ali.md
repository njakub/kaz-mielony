## Cooking for the Greatest

Muhammad Ali floated like a butterfly, stung like a bee, and when the fight was over he wanted the comfort of home. Born Cassius Clay in Louisville in 1942, Ali became the most recognisable athlete on the planet: Olympic champion, three-time heavyweight title holder, fearless civil rights advocate, and a master of the microphone. Away from the lights and cameras he loved a plate that chef Edith and the family kept in steady rotation: baked chicken, macaroni and cheese, spinach, and green peas. Today I am cooking that spread, following the stories his daughter Laila has shared and adding just enough of my own touch to make the plate sing.

## Mac and Cheese, Southern Style

Ali was disciplined in training camp, but at home he wanted the creamy baked mac that holds its shape. Cook 450 g macaroni one minute shy of al dente so it can finish in the oven. In a large bowl whisk together 300 ml cream, 200 ml milk, and two eggs. Season with 1 tsp each garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika, plus 1/2 tsp cayenne and 1/2 tsp mustard powder. Stir in softened cream cheese along with diced American slices, shredded mozzarella, and half of the grated mild and mature cheddar. Fold in the cooled macaroni, pour into a buttered baking dish, and blanket with the remaining cheese. This is a no-roux, one-bowl method that bakes into a custardy slab that slices cleanly on a plate.

## Baked Chicken with a Title Belt Rub

For the chicken I spatchcock a 2 kg bird so it roasts quickly and evenly. Mix 2 1/2 tsp sea salt with rosemary, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, black pepper, a spoon of vegetable oil, and Worcestershire sauce. Work the paste under and over the skin, then roast the bird at 200C (390F). Ten minutes in, slide the mac and cheese onto the shelf beside it. Roast for roughly 45 minutes more until the chicken hits 75C (167F) at the thigh and the macaroni top turns burnished and crisp. Rest the bird so the juices settle before carving.

## Greens with Heat and Sweet

Ali's plate needs greens. Melt butter in a pan, sweat half an onion until translucent, and stir in minced garlic, a pinch of chilli flakes, and a spoon of mint sauce. Toss in frozen peas with a splash of water, simmer until almost dry, then fold through a mound of spinach until it wilts. The mint keeps things bright, the chilli adds a jab of heat, and the peas bring gentle sweetness to balance the rich mac and chicken.

## Plate Up Like a Champion

Let the chicken and mac rest for 5 to 10 minutes, then carve big pieces and slice clean squares of macaroni. Add the spinach and peas on the side, and if you remembered the hot buttered rolls Ali loved, now is the time to serve them. During training he ate plain steak and vegetables, sacrificing flavour for focus. This home-style plate is the opposite: rich, comforting, and joyfully indulgent. Every bite is a reminder that even the greatest needed time away from the ring to recharge around the family table.
