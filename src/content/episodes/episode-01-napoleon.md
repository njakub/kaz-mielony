## The Emperor's Unexpected Sweet Tooth

Welcome to the very first episode of Kaz Mielony! Today we're diving into one of history's most fascinating contradictions: Napoleon Bonaparte's love for simple honey cakes. While he conquered most of Europe with military genius, his personal tastes remained surprisingly humble.

## Why Start with Napoleon?

Napoleon represents the perfect example of how food connects us to historical figures in unexpected ways. Here was a man who dined with kings and emperors, yet his favorite treat was a simple honey cake that reminded him of his Corsican childhood.

## The Recipe's Journey

These honey cakes traveled with Napoleon from Corsica to the palaces of Europe, and finally to his exile on St. Helena. They represent continuity in a life of constant change—a sweet constant in the chaos of empire-building.

## What We Discovered

During filming, I was struck by how the aroma of honey and spices filled the kitchen, just as it would have in Napoleon's field kitchens. These weren't just desserts—they were portable energy, comfort food, and a taste of home all rolled into one.

## Historical Cooking Notes

The biggest challenge was sourcing period-appropriate honey. Modern processed honey lacks the complex flavors that Napoleon would have known. We used raw wildflower honey from a local beekeeper, which brought depth and character to the final cakes.
