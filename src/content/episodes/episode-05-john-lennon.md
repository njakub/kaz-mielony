## Introduction

Today on Kaz Cooks History, where I cook up the go-to meals of historical figures, both famous and infamous, we're cooking like John Lennon—Liverpool-born Beatle, peace campaigner and professional wind-up merchant. But forget charts and chants—what did he actually eat?

Early on it was pure British café comfort: steak and chips, egg and chips, beans, bacon. Later in New York he called his diet "mostly macrobiotic"… then immediately admitted to pizza, cappuccinos and Hershey bars, all while bragging he'd been baking bread as a stay-at-home dad.
