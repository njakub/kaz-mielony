## Introduction

Born Farrokh Bulsara on September 5, 1946 in Zanzibar, raised in India, and relocated to Middlesex in 1964, Freddie built his life in West London—ultimately at Garden Lodge in Kensington. As the charismatic frontman of Queen, he was famed for his powerhouse vocals and for writing timeless classics like 'Bohemian Rhapsody,' 'We Are the Champions,' and 'Don't Stop Me Now.'

The charismatic frontman of Queen gained global fame for his powerhouse vocals and unforgettable lyrics. But today I'm more interested in what filled his plate.

## Breakfast: Homemade Jam and Marmalade on Toast

> "For breakfast, he kept it simple, tea, two slices of toast and jam. I made 12 jars of marmalade and 12 jars of strawberry jam when the fruit was in season. These would keep for a year until the next batch was made." - Peter Freestone, Personal Assistant

## Lunch: Mediterranean Lentil Soup

Freddie enjoyed light lunches, so this Mediterranean lentil soup, straight from his assistant's cookbook, fits the bill perfectly. This veggie lunch was surprisingly wholesome—more like a stew than a soup, but feels like every spoonful is healing you.

## Dinner: Chicken Dhansak

For dinner: chicken dhansak. This traditional Parsi dish packs a punch and was a well-documented Freddie Mercury favorite.

> "When I started working for Freddie in 1979, Freddie loved spicy food. Not necessarily hot chili, but food flavored with many different exotic spices. His favorite curry was chicken dhansak, a chicken curry made from vegetables and lentils." - Peter Freestone

## Freddie's Love for Natural Food

Freddie was particular about eating natural, healthy foods. As he explained in a Dutch magazine interview:

> "I try to eat as much natural food as possible. Mainly vegetables and fruits. All that food in tin cans, I don't want that. I want to get old in good health, and you can do that if you be careful about what you eat. I especially love bananas. Each day I try to eat about six of them."

This philosophy of natural eating shaped all his meal choices, from homemade preserves to fresh ingredients in his curries.
