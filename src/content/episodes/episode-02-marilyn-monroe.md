## The Real Marilyn's Diet

In this episode of Kaz Cooks History, I spend a full day eating exactly like Marilyn Monroe — not the Hollywood fantasy version, but the way she actually ate, based on her own notes and documented habits. Along the way, I discover that her diet swung from charmingly simple to downright challenging.

## The Menu

**Breakfast** – Marilyn's famously odd start to the day: a warm milk and raw egg drink, paired with a multivitamin.

**Lunch** – A surprisingly creamy spaghetti pomodoro, made only with blended tomatoes and extra virgin olive oil — no cheese, no butter.

**Dinner** – Broiled liver with a side of raw carrot sticks (three to five, as she reportedly ate), an intense flavour and texture combination that truly tested my willpower.
