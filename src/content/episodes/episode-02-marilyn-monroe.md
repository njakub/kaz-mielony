## The Real Marilyn's Diet

In this episode of Kaz Cooks History, I spend a full day eating exactly like Marilyn Monroe — not the Hollywood fantasy version, but the way she actually ate, based on her own notes and documented habits. Along the way, I discover that her diet swung from charmingly simple to downright challenging.

## The Menu

**Breakfast** – Marilyn's famously odd start to the day: a warm milk and raw egg drink, paired with a multivitamin.

**Lunch** – A surprisingly creamy spaghetti pomodoro, made only with blended tomatoes and extra virgin olive oil — no cheese, no butter.

**Dinner** – Broiled liver with a side of raw carrot sticks (three to five, as she reportedly ate), an intense flavour and texture combination that truly tested my willpower.

## Historical Context

Marilyn Monroe (1926-1962) was known for her beauty and glamour, but her relationship with food was complex and deeply personal. She often turned to simple, comforting dishes that connected her to happier times, particularly foods that reminded her of her foster families and early Hollywood days.

Despite the pressures of maintaining her figure for the camera, Monroe found joy in these unpretentious meals that grounded her in an otherwise chaotic life.
