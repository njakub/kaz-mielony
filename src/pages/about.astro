        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-primary">The Concept</h2>
        <p class="text-text-light/90">
          History isn't just about dates, battles, and political movements—it's about the people who lived it. 
          And what better way to understand historical figures than through something as intimate and personal 
          as their favorite meals?
        </p>
        <p class="text-text-light/90">
          Each episode of Kaz Mielony takes you on a culinary journey through time, recreating dishes that 
          were beloved by some of history's most fascinating—and sometimes controversial—figures. From the 
          lavish banquets of emperors to the simple comfort foods of revolutionaries, every meal tells a story.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Food and History?</h2>
      <p>
        Food is one of the most universal human experiences. It transcends time, connecting us to people 
        who lived centuries ago through shared tastes, techniques, and traditions. When we cook Napoleon's 
        favorite honey cakes or prepare a meal that sustained medieval knights, we're not just following 
        recipes—we're participating in history.
      </p>

      <p>
        These recipes offer unique insights into:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The economic conditions of different time periods</li>
        <li>Cultural exchange and trade routes</li>
        <li>Social hierarchies and class distinctions</li>
        <li>Personal preferences that humanize historical figures</li>
        <li>The evolution of cooking techniques and ingredients</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Research Process</h2>
      <p>
        Every episode begins with extensive historical research. I dive into:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Period cookbooks and manuscripts</li>
        <li>Personal letters and diaries</li>
        <li>Historical accounts from servants and contemporaries</li>
        <li>Archaeological evidence of dining practices</li>
        <li>Regional food traditions and availability</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Sometimes the recipes need adaptation for modern kitchens and ingredients, but I always strive 
        to maintain the authentic spirit and flavors of the original dishes.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Controversial Figures</h2>
      <p>
        Not all historical figures featured on this channel were saints—many were complex individuals 
        who made both positive and negative impacts on history. By exploring their culinary preferences, 
        I aim to present a more nuanced view of history that acknowledges both the human side of these 
        figures and the full context of their actions.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Food is politically neutral, but the people who ate it often weren't. These episodes are an 
        opportunity to discuss history thoughtfully and completely.
